									<p>This game was our submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2024 and placed us top 35% overall.</p>
									<p>We came up with the idea for this game from the theme, "Built to Scale". Inspired by games like Jump King, Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, and A Difficult Game about Climbing, it interprets the theme with a level that has the option for randomized level generation (hence "built") that can be climbed by the player (hence "scale").</p>	
									<p>This was the first game we were able to successfully submit in time for the game jam due to successful scope management and confining the game to 2D. This greatly improved our ability to spend significant time playtesting.</p>
									<p>I was responsible for all sprites, animations, menu art, level design, tilesets, SFX, and fine-tuning gameplay. I also programmed the randomized level generation and handled some bug fixing. My friends from school who I worked on the project with were responsible for programming the climbing and movement, alongside menu functionality.</p>
									<p>The climbing mechanic works by sending out rays vertically to intersect with hitboxes and turns off gravity if the player clicks while the ray intersects with the hitbox. Randomized level generation chooses a random tile out of a tileset every time the randomize option is selected.</p>
									<p>For level design, the default level was designed to give a clear progression in the path to take, but the path itself increasing in difficulty rapidly. While the early stages of the level simply require short vertical or horizontal jumps, The final stage forces the player to take the longest possible jumps with the smallest hitboxes while dangling over a drop that brings the player back to the first stage. This makes the game more exciting to play and adds to the frustration that "foddian" games usually have.</p>
									<p>In the future, we hope to add more levels, a story, and general polish to the mechanics such as possibly replacing the rays with simply detecting the player hitbox colliding so that it intersects more accurately with rocks. We also hope to make it more similar to Jump King in that the initial force given in a jump cannot be adjusted after jumping.</p>

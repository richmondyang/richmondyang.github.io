									<p>This was our submission for the Congressional App Challenge 2023, getting us runner-up in the district.</p>
									<p>The app makes use of Tkinter for the UI and accesses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather information about a given address. This information is then put into a formula to calculate heat risk index, which then tells the user whether it is too hot to stay outside or not based on the temperature and humidity. The app also has a hydration tracker that can set a goal for water to drink based on a number of user-provided factors, and track water that the user has already drunk.</p>	
									<p>The most time consuming aspects of the project was working with Tkinter for UI. Tkinter only provides incredibly basic UI functions and this resulted in challenges making seemingly simple features such as a scroll bar. Programming a website with HTML, CSS, and Javascript would've simplified the process immensely while keeping the app accessible. We also spent a lot of time trying to make an interactive map for the app but it ended up not functioning as intended and fully live updates were scrapped, although we would like to explore remaking the app as a website in the future and possibly implement an interactive map to make the user experience more satisfying.</p>
									<p>As one of the first formal programming projects beyond assignments in online courses, this project helped train skills for making things without just following tutorials or instructions. Making the video for the project was also very fun and it was overall an enjoyable experience.</p>

									<p>This game was our submission to the Pirate Software Game Jam 15.</p>
									<p>Prior to the game jam, we were already planning to make a game about interacting with shadows, so when the theme came out and it was "Shadows and Alchemy", we were pleasantly surprised that we already had a base to work off of.</p>	
									<p></p>
									<p>I was responsible for all sprites, animations, menu art, level design, tilesets, SFX, and fine-tuning gameplay. I also programmed the randomized level generation and handled some bug fixing. My friends from school who I worked on the project with were responsible for programming the climbing and movement, alongside menu functionality.</p>
									<p>The climbing mechanic works by sending out rays vertically to intersect with hitboxes and turns off gravity if the player clicks while the ray intersects with the hitbox. Randomized level generation chooses a random tile out of a tileset every time the randomize option is selected.</p>
									<p>For level design, the default level was designed to give a clear progression in the path to take, but the path itself increasing in difficulty rapidly. While the early stages of the level simply require short vertical or horizontal jumps, The final stage forces the player to take the longest possible jumps with the smallest hitboxes while dangling over a drop that brings the player back to the first stage. This makes the game more exciting to play and adds to the frustration that foddian games usually have.</p>
									<p>While we were unable to submit the game this time, we think the ideas are valuable to work off of</p>

									<p>This game was our submission to the Pirate Software Game Jam 15.</p>
									<p>Prior to the game jam, we were already planning to make a game about interacting with shadows, so when the theme came out and it was "Shadows and Alchemy", we were pleasantly surprised that we already had a base to work off of.</p>	
									<p>We interpreted shadows as a mechanic where the player needs to stay in shadows to recover health and staying too long in the light will start to cause damage. We interpreted alchemy as a crafting mechanic, where enemies would drop scraps of junk and the player could craft different weapons or items based on a combination of the drops.</p>
									<p>I was responsible for all 3D models, animations, the environment, and props. My friends at school who I was working with were responsible for programming the combat, movement, menus, crafting, and weapons.</p>
									<p>For the environment, we settled on a dingy sewer where the player, a raccoon, would be trying to escape. Trash has alchemized into monsters and the player needs to defeat them and craft their way out of the sewer. Below are the models and animations made for the project, featuring a protagonist, 4 basic enemies, and a boss.</p>
									<p>For more information on design specifics, refer to the Game Design Document attached in the description of the itch.io page.</p>
